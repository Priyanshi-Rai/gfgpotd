"""This is a solution to a problem involving a binary tree with integer node values, a starting node, and a distance limit k. The goal is to find the sum of the node values of all nodes that are at most k distance away from the starting node.

The function ladoos takes three arguments: root is the root of the binary tree, home is the value of the starting node, and k is the distance limit.

The function first precomputes the parent pointers for all nodes in the binary tree using the helper function _precompute. The starting node is also identified and stored in the variable start.

Then, the function uses a recursive helper function _solve to compute the sum of the node values of all nodes that are at most k distance away from the starting node. The function _solve takes three arguments: nd is the current node being considered, dis is the remaining distance limit from the starting node, and prev is the parent of the current node. The function recursively calls itself on the left child, right child, and parent of the current node, as long as the child is not the same as the previous node and the remaining distance limit is non-negative. The sum of the node values of all nodes visited is accumulated in the variable ans.

Finally, the function returns the value of ans as the result.
