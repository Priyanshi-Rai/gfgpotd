"""The given code is an implementation of the Maximum Bipartite Matching (MBM) algorithm in Python. 
MBM is a problem in graph theory where we need to find the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph such that no two edges share an endpoint. 
In other words, we need to find the largest set of edges such that no two edges share a vertex.

The algorithm uses the Depth-First Search (DFS) technique to find a solution.

The code defines a class Solution with a single method maximumMatch that takes as input a 2D list G representing the bipartite graph. 
It starts by finding the number of rows m and columns n in the graph, and initializing two arrays match and visited with -1 and False respectively.
The array match stores the matching information, and the array visited is used to keep track of the visited nodes during the DFS.

The dfs function is a recursive function that takes a node i and finds the matching partner for that node.
The function iterates over all the columns in the graph and checks if the node i and column j are connected and if j has not been visited.
If both conditions are satisfied, 
it marks the column j as visited and then checks if j has no matching partner or if its matching partner has a further matching partner. 
If either of these conditions is true, j is assigned as the matching partner for i. The function returns True if a matching partner is found, and False otherwise.

The main part of the maximumMatch method iterates over all the rows in the graph and calls the dfs function for each row. 
If the dfs function returns True, it increments the count variable.
Finally, the count variable is returned, which represents the maximum number of edges in the bipartite graph."""
