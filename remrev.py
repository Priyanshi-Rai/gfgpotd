"""This is a Python function named removeReverse that takes a string s as input and removes all the characters that have duplicates, alternating between removing from the start and end of the string until there are no more characters to remove. If at the end of the process the string is not empty, it returns the string. Otherwise, it returns the reverse of the string.

The function first uses the collections.Counter function to count the occurrences of each character in the string. It then initializes a variable i to 0 and a variable d to 1. The variable i is used to keep track of the current index in the string being examined, while d alternates between 1 and -1 to determine whether characters are being removed from the start or end of the string.

The function then enters a loop that continues as long as i is a valid index in the string. If the current character at index i has a count greater than 1 in the Counter object, indicating that it has duplicates, the function decrements the count for that character, removes it from the string using slicing, and updates the value of i and d to alternate between removing from the start and end of the string. If the current character does not have duplicates, the function simply increments i by d to move on to the next character.

Finally, the function returns the original string if d is greater than 0, indicating that characters were last removed from the end of the string, and returns the reverse of the string otherwise.
