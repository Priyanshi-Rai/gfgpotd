"""This code defines a class TreeNode representing a node in a binary tree. Each node has a value (data) and references to its left and right children.

The Solution class contains a method constructBinaryTree that takes three inputs: pre, preMirror, and size. pre is a list representing the preorder traversal of a binary tree, preMirror is a list representing the mirror image of the preorder traversal, and size is the size of the binary tree.

The method starts by creating two dictionaries d and d1. The dictionary d maps the values in preMirror to their indices, and the dictionary d1 maps the values in pre to their indices.

The method then calls a helper function solve with initial parameters. The solve function takes the following arguments:

prei: Index of the current node in the pre list
prem: Index of the current node in the preMirror list
pre: The pre list
preM: The preMirror list
size: The size of the binary tree
dM: The dictionary mapping values in preMirror to their indices
dPre: The dictionary mapping values in pre to their indices
The solve function recursively constructs the binary tree using preorder traversal. It first checks if the current indices prei and prem are within the valid range. If not, it returns None.

Then, it creates a new TreeNode instance with the value at index pre[prei]. If there are more nodes in the preorder traversal, it checks if the left child of the current node exists. If it does, it retrieves the left child's value and its index in the preMirror list (left and leftM). It compares the index of the left child with the index of the current node to determine if it is a valid left child. If it is, it recursively calls solve to construct the left subtree.

After constructing the left subtree, it checks if there is a right child for the current node. If there is, it retrieves the right child's value and its index in the pre list (right and rightI). It then recursively calls solve to construct the right subtree.

Finally, it returns the constructed node r representing the current subtree.

The constructBinaryTree method catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the code and prints them. This is useful for debugging purposes.

In summary, the code constructs a binary tree from the preorder traversal and its mirror image. It uses dictionaries to map values to their indices for efficient lookup during tree construction. The solve function recursively constructs the tree by checking the indices and values in the preorder traversals."""
