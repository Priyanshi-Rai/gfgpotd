"""This function takes in a target sum target and a root node root of a binary search tree (BST). The goal is to find the minimum number of nodes one needs to remove from the BST so that the sum of the values of the remaining nodes equals target. If it's not possible to find such a subtree, return -1.

The function starts by defining a helper function _solve(nd) that will be called recursively on each node of the tree. The _solve function returns a tuple with five values: the sum of values of the subtree rooted at nd, a boolean indicating whether the subtree rooted at nd is a valid BST, the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at nd, the minimum value in the subtree rooted at nd, and the maximum value in the subtree rooted at nd.

The function then initializes the variable ans to positive infinity, which will be used to keep track of the minimum number of nodes that need to be removed to obtain the target sum. Then, the function calls the _solve function on the root node to start the recursion.

Within the _solve function, we first check if the input node nd exists (is not None). If nd is None, we return a tuple with all values initialized to defaults (0, True, 0, inf, -inf).

If nd is not None, we then call _solve recursively on the left and right children of nd. We store the results of these recursive calls in Lsum, Lisbst, Lcnt, Lmin, Lmax for the left subtree and Rsum, Risbst, Rcnt, Rmin, Rmax for the right subtree. These variables store the sum of values, whether the subtree rooted at that node is a valid BST, the number of nodes, the minimum value, and the maximum value of each subtree.

Next, we check if the subtree rooted at nd is a valid BST. A binary search tree is a tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of all the nodes in its left subtree and less than or equal to the values of all the nodes in its right subtree. If the left or right subtree is not a valid BST, or if nd is not in the correct position relative to its children, we return a tuple with the boolean set to False and all other values initialized to defaults.

If the subtree rooted at nd is a valid BST, we calculate the sum of values su of the subtree rooted at nd, which is equal to the sum of the values of the left subtree, the value of nd, and the sum of the values of the right subtree. We also calculate the total number of nodes tot in the subtree rooted at nd.

If su is equal to the target sum target, we update the ans variable to be the minimum of its current value and tot.

Finally, we update Lmin and Rmax if the left or right child of nd is None, respectively, and we return a tuple with su, True, tot, Lmin, and Rmax.

After calling _solve on the root node, the function returns ans if it is not equal to positive infinity (meaning a valid subtree was found), or -1 if ans was not updated (meaning a valid subtree was not found)."""
