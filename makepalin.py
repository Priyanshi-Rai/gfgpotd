"""This is a solution to the problem of determining whether it is possible to rearrange the given list of strings in such a way that each string becomes a palindrome. The input parameters are n, an integer representing the length of the list, and arr, the list of strings to be rearranged.

The function first creates a new list that is a copy of the original list but with each string reversed using slicing notation ([::1]). This is done using a list comprehension: sorted([i[::-1] for i in arr]).

The two lists are then compared to see if they contain the same elements. If they do, it means that each string in the original list can be rearranged to form a palindrome, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False. This is done using the sorted function, which returns a sorted list, and the == operator, which checks for equality. The comparison is done as follows: sorted([i[::-1] for i in arr])==sorted(arr)."""
