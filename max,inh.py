"""The given code is implementing a binary search algorithm to find the maximum possible minimum height h of a stack of boxes with heights a, width w, and total number of boxes n, such that there are at least k boxes with height at least h.

The _try function checks whether it is possible to construct a stack of boxes with minimum height tar. It first initializes a list mods to keep track of the height adjustments needed for each box to reach the target height. Then, it iterates through each box and calculates the actual height v of the box after applying the height adjustments. If v is less than the target height tar, it adjusts the heights of the current and the next w-1 boxes to make v equal to tar. It updates the mods list accordingly and decrements the left variable that keeps track of the number of boxes that still need to be adjusted. If left becomes negative at any point, it means that it is not possible to construct a stack with minimum height tar and at least k boxes with height at least tar.

The binary search is performed on the range of possible minimum heights between the minimum height L of any box and the maximum possible height L+k+1 that can be obtained by stacking k boxes of height L on top of each other. At each iteration, the midpoint m of the range is calculated and the _try function is called to check whether it is possible to construct a stack with minimum height m. If it is possible, the minimum height is increased by setting L to m+1. Otherwise, the maximum height is reduced by setting R to m. The binary search terminates when L and R become equal.

Finally, the maximum possible minimum height is returned by subtracting 1 from L, which gives the largest possible minimum height that satisfies the condition. This is because the binary search always keeps the largest possible minimum height in the L variable."""
