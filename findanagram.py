 """This code defines a method findAnagrams that takes two arguments: head and s. head is the head of a linked list and s is a string. The method finds all anagrams of s in the linked list and returns a list of the heads of the sublists that contain the anagrams.

The method first initializes a variable N to be the length of the string s. It also initializes a list TAR with 26 zeros. TAR is used to store the count of each character in the string s. Each character's count is incremented by one using the ord function to get its corresponding index in TAR.

The method then initializes several variables: ans is an empty list that will store the head of each sublist containing anagrams, h and t are pointers to the head of the linked list, and F is a list that will store the count of each character in the current sublist being examined. F is set to None initially so that it is computed for the first sublist.

The method then enters a loop that continues until t is None. In each iteration of the loop, the method checks if F is None. If it is, F is initialized as a list of 26 zeros, and then the method iterates over the next N nodes in the linked list, updating F with the count of each character in the sublist. The loop breaks if t becomes None.

If F is not None, the method updates F for the next sublist by subtracting the count of the character at the head of the current sublist and adding the count of the character at the tail of the current sublist. The method also updates h and t to move to the next sublist.

If F is equal to TAR, the method has found an anagram. It appends h to ans and then iterates over the sublist to set all the next pointers to None. It then updates h to point to the next node after the current sublist, sets F to None to compute it for the next sublist, and continues the loop.

Finally, the method returns ans, which contains the heads of all the sublists containing anagrams of s in the linked list."""
