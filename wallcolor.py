"""The code is defining a class Solution with a single function minCost. The function takes in two inputs: colors, a 2D list where each element is a list of length 3 representing the cost of painting a house with a certain color, and N, the number of houses.

The function uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost of painting N houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. The function creates three arrays, a, b, and c, each of length N, to store the minimum cost of painting each house with a certain color (red, green, and blue respectively).

The function starts by initializing the minimum cost of painting the first house with each color, which is stored in a[0], b[0], and c[0] respectively.

For each house i in N, the minimum cost of painting it with a certain color is calculated using the minimum cost of painting the previous house with the other two colors. This is done using the formula a[i] = colors[i][0] + min(b[i-1], c[i-1]), b[i] = colors[i][1] + min(a[i-1], c[i-1]), and c[i] = colors[i][2] + min(b[i-1], a[i-1]).

Finally, the function returns the minimum cost of painting all the houses by taking the minimum of the last element of each of the a, b, and c arrays. The final result is the minimum cost of painting all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color."""
