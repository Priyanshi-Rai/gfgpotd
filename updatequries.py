 """This is a Python function that takes three parameters: N, Q, and U. The purpose of the function is to update a query based on a given list of updates U and return a list ans of results.

The function first initializes some variables, including the BCNT constant, which is set to 17. It then creates a list upd of empty lists with a length of N+1, which will be used to store the updates.

Next, the function iterates through each query in U. For each query, it appends the value x to the l-1th index of upd and the negative value of x to the rth index of upd.

After that, the function creates a list ans of length N initialized to zero. It then iterates through each index in the range N. If the upd list has any values for that index, the function updates the bits list based on the values in upd. The bits list is used to keep track of which bits have been set in the updates.

The function then sets the tmp variable to zero and iterates through the bits list. If a bit has been set, it sets the corresponding bit in tmp to one. This creates a new number with only the bits that have been set in the updates.

Finally, the function appends the value of tmp to the ans list and returns it. The ans list contains the updated values for the query."""
