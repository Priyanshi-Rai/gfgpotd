"""This is a solution to the problem of finding the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of an array equal by performing a bit manipulation operation on any two adjacent elements of the array.

The function bitMagic takes in two arguments: an integer n which represents the number of elements in the array, and a list arr which represents the array.

The algorithm starts with two pointers, start and end, pointing to the first and last element of the array respectively. It also initializes a counter variable count to 0.

It then enters a loop that runs as long as start is less than or equal to end. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if the values at start and end are different. If they are, it means that an operation is needed to make them equal. The counter variable count is incremented, and both pointers are moved one step closer to each other (i.e. start is incremented and end is decremented). If they are equal, no operation is needed, and both pointers are moved as described.

After the loop finishes, the function checks if count is even or odd. If it is odd, the function returns (count//2)+1. If it is even, the function returns count//2.

The reason for adding 1 to the result if count is odd is because if there are an odd number of operations needed to make all elements equal, then the first operation can be performed on any adjacent pair of elements, and then the remaining operations can be performed in pairs on the remaining elements."""
