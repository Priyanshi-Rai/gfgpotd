"""The given code is implementing a function called maxPossibleValue that takes three input arguments - N, A, and B. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

Initializes a variable mn with a very large integer value of 1e9. This variable is used to keep track of the minimum value of A[i] encountered so far.
Initializes two variables count and res to zero. count is used to keep track of the total number of rectangle pairs encountered so far, and res is used to accumulate the maximum possible value.
Iterates through each element i in the range from 0 to N-1.
Checks if the value of B[i] is greater than 1.
If B[i] is greater than 1, it calculates the number of rectangle pairs possible by dividing B[i] by 2 (since each rectangle requires 2 squares).
It then multiplies the number of rectangle pairs by 2*A[i] to get the total value of the rectangle pairs for the current element.
Updates the value of mn to the minimum of mn and A[i]. This is done to keep track of the minimum value of A[i] encountered so far.
Adds the current rectangle pairs' total value to res.
Increments the value of count by the number of rectangle pairs encountered in the current element.
Checks if count is odd (i.e., the total number of rectangle pairs encountered so far is odd).
If count is odd, subtracts twice the value of mn from res. This is done because we need an even number of rectangle pairs to form the maximum possible value. So, we remove the value of the smallest A[i] encountered so far twice to adjust the count and make it even.
Finally, the function returns the accumulated value of res as the maximum possible value."""
