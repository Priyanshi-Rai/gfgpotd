"""This code appears to be a solution to a problem where given a graph represented by an adjacency matrix and a set of numbers, 
it calculates the number of "lucky permutations" (it's not clear from the code what a lucky permutation is). 
The solution uses dynamic programming to iterate through all possible subsets of the set of numbers and count the number of valid permutations.
The adjacency matrix is used to check if the numbers in the current subset are connected in the graph. The final count of lucky permutations is returned."""
