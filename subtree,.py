"""This is a Python class Solution that has a method duplicateSubtreeNaryTree that takes a node root of an N-ary tree as input and returns the number of duplicate subtrees in the tree.

The method initializes a dictionary self.map in the constructor, which will be used to store the string representation of each subtree in the tree as a key and the number of occurrences of that subtree as a value.

The solve method is a recursive helper function that takes a node root as input, and returns the string representation of the subtree rooted at that node. It does this by concatenating the string representation of the current node's key with the string representation of each of its children, which are obtained by recursively calling the solve method on each child node.

The solve method then updates the self.map dictionary by incrementing the value corresponding to the string representation of the current subtree.

The duplicateSubtreeNaryTree method calls the solve method on the input root to populate the self.map dictionary with the string representations of all the subtrees in the tree and their occurrences. It then iterates over the keys of the self.map dictionary and counts the number of keys that have a value greater than 1, which indicates the number of duplicate subtrees in the tree. Finally, it returns this count as the output."""
