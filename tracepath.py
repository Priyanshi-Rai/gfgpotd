"""This code defines a function isPossible that takes three inputs: n, m, and s. Here, n and m represent the dimensions of a grid, and s is a string consisting of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', representing left, right, up, and down directions, respectively.

The function calculates the minimum and maximum values of dx and dy while iterating over each character in the string s. The values of dx and dy represent the cumulative movements in the x and y directions, respectively.

For each character d in the string s, the code updates dx and dy based on the direction indicated by d. It also updates the minimum and maximum values of dx and dy to track the boundaries of the movements.

After iterating through all the characters in s, the code checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values of dx is less than m and the difference between the maximum and minimum values of dy is less than n. If both conditions are true, it returns 1 (interpreted as True), indicating that it is possible to move within the grid boundaries. Otherwise, it returns 0 (interpreted as False), indicating that it is not possible to stay within the grid boundaries.

In summary, the function checks whether the cumulative movements represented by the string s stay within the boundaries of the grid of dimensions n and m.
